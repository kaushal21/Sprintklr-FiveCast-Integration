2021-11-29T06:43:57Z,"Sunday was one of the most rewarding and inspiring days in all the years that we have been creating rallies. It was overwhelming to witness how far we have come as a movement and more than once was I moved to tears looking at how many people are now standing with us and how ready this country is for a change. I‚Äôm sure this affected many people in different ways. You probably didn‚Äôt see but there were many tears on stage from our speakers, many who have been speaking about vaccines long before covid, and long before anyone would listen. To see how far we have come in such a short time is thanks to YOU ALL!! I won't disrespect the day, the speakers or the amazing people who turned up by drawing rumours, gossip, other people and their actions outside of our rally into it. What I'm choosing to focus on is how to keep the momentum going, and using the energy and connection we co created on Sunday, making sure we stay focused, strong and move forward as a community, together. We can affect meaningful and long lasting change. MMAMV represents a very niche subject, yet touches all of us. Mandatory vaccines. That is all. We ask for respect and choice, the ability to choose what's best for ours and our children's bodies. MMAMV does not have a particular political leaning or a religious dogma or any kind of background agenda. We stand for YOU ALL. We stand in integrity and authenticity. We cannot be moved because we stand for the children and the future. This goes beyond us and reaches far into generations to come. We must act now, and coming this far, we will not back down. Thanks to everyone who came and contributed to making it such a positive celebration of community and the way forward. We are winning!!!! (Attached are some highlights from the weekend, along with some shots from our first national event in May 2020.) We look forward to seeing you all (and more) at our next offical MMAMV events, and also look forward to supporting in any way any other people and groups that are also fighting for us all. #mmamv #freedomkeepersunited #wegotthis #togetherunited",https://www.facebook.com/MMAMVAUSTRALIA/posts/440042267716207,facebook,PostedOnFacebookActivity

Del Bigtree is one of the preeminent voices of the Vaccine Risk Awareness Movement. His career as an Emmy winning producer of the CBS talk show, The Doctors, changed profoundly when he produced the documentary, Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe, which is credited with igniting a revolution against pharmaceutical tyranny around the world. Now Del‚Äôs internet news show, The HighWire, is the fastest-growing program in the natural health arena with over 75 million views. His non-profit, the Informed Consent Action Network, or ICAN, is leading worldwide investigations into drug and vaccine fraud that have already resulted in multiple winning lawsuits against US Government agencies Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, CDC and FDA. But Del is probably best known for his powerful speeches that weave shocking truth, searing wit and dynamic passion into an experience that is often described as electrifying.",https://www.facebook.com/MMAMVAUSTRALIA/posts/267711694949266,facebook,SharedAPostOnFacebookActivity

Max has now been sharing his insights and observations with live audiences for a number of years, and has also produced two full-length films, The Awakening in 2011, and Trance-Formation in 2012, both of which have been widely acclaimed and watched by well over one million viewers worldwide.",https://www.facebook.com/MMAMVAUSTRALIA/posts/320597832993985,facebook,PostedOnFacebookActivity

The death certificate states immunisation is one of the causes of death. We also cover a fit, vibrant, 21-year-old man Ronnie Ayoub from Greenacre, NSW. Ronnie was forced into getting the jab so that he could go back to work, and get back to a normal life. Ronnie experienced a denial of links to the jab by health professionals, blaming his mental health. We now have three victims with a neurological disorder where it has been blamed on mental health. We will be bringing you the third story next week.

2022-01-24T06:33:16Z,"Imagine that you take your child to the river one day... When you find your spot in the sand you notice there are several people there, but many of them are not in the water. You think to yourself, I wonder why so many people are out of the water. Despite your brief, concerning observation, you proceed to go into the water with your child. As you're sitting at the edge watching your child play in the water a few feet away, you suddenly realize a large crocodile within inches of them. You begin to panic. You know there is no way you will make it to your child before the croc attacks. You watch in horror as your child is injured or killed by the croc. Instantly, you regret your decision to let your child go into the water, but it's too late, because the damage has already been done... Now imagine if after the attack, you find out others at the creek knew there was a dangerous croc in the water, which is the reason many people weren't in the water. How would you feel? Would you be hurt and confused that no one cared enough about you or your child to mention the danger? Would you spend the rest of your life knowing the incident (injury or death) could have been avoided if someone had just warned you? Would you live with regret for not asking the people around you why so many of them were staying out of the water? Would you also be frustrated with yourself for not digging deeper after the initial observation of realizing there were many people, who for some reason, were staying out of the water? Let's say someone did warn you ahead of time...what would you do? Would you have stayed out of the water and avoided the croc completely? Would you have proceeded into the water cautiously? Would you have warned new-comers that there was a dangerous croc in the water? Let's say you allowed your child to play in the water knowing there was a croc...if your child didn't get attacked (injured or killed), would that make the croc-infested water any less dangerous? Would the water be safer just because your child wasn't immediately affected by the danger in the water? Would the croc be less of a threat just because it didn't immediately injure or kill your child? The croc is still there, whether it causes immediate damage/death or not. The possibility of a croc attack still exists. Therefore, the danger is still present because the croc is dangerous. Add to that there is a ‚Äúlifeguard‚Äù near by who knows the croc is there but instead starts screaming at people to jump in the water to get away from the blow flies. Now... think of vaccines as being the croc and the doctor as being the ‚Äúlifeguard. I refuse to be the person who sits silently on the edge and doesn't take the time to warn others about the croc in the water. If you don‚Äôt want to hear about the croc, then move along. You can‚Äôt speak for everyone and most parents want to be warned. üêä",https://www.facebook.com/MMAMVAUSTRALIA/posts/474380094282424,facebook,PostedOnFacebookActivity

2021-10-22T01:49:17Z,"My name is Chantal, I'm a 37 year old Police Officer from Western Australia and I had a severe reaction after receiving the Pfizer vaccine. To the people who threatened me with defamation charges and disciplinary action for telling my story, I am disappointed. I'm disappointed that your priority is to silence me for your own ego and agenda rather than ask if I'm ok and offer me any help! At no time have you asked if I'm ok or cared for a second about my health or welfare. You decided that putting me under more stress, when that stress can cause further risk to my life is your priority. It makes me question humanity and how any person can have such a lack of empathy towards another. If defamation and disciplinary action is what you deem suitable than I'm not afraid. I've done nothing wrong, I did what you wanted and look what happened. No one has the right to take away anyone else's experiences or tell them how they should feel. Please believe me when I say, there is nothing that you can do to me that will even compare to what I am currently experiencing. Treating someone in this way is never ok and if people can take any lesson away from this then please stand up for yourself. Set standards as to how you should be treated and don't ever be silent if someone is treating you poorly regardless of their relationship to you. Within 10 minutes of getting the Pfizer vaccine, I got vertigo and nausea and within 15 minutes I had hives all over me. The doctor and ambulance officer got the rash under control but as soon as I got home I had a fever, chills and felt very unwell. For the following 3.5 weeks I suffered rashes every day, fevers as high as 39.7, aching muscles, flu like symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pressure in my sinuses and a cough so bad that it felt like my blood vessels were going to explode in my face. Some days I cried because I thought I was going to die. I was so sick. When I thought I was starting to get better, I still had extreme fatigue and was constantly light headed. I was admitted to hospital. I was taken for more tests which showed that the main artery to my brain had a rupture and I had suffered a mini stroke (TIA).",https://www.facebook.com/MMAMVAUSTRALIA/posts/416319596755141,facebook,PostedOnFacebookActivity

2022-02-11T09:15:49Z,"Thank you to Denholm Samaras and the Canberra Weekly for writing a fair story for the Canberra Community. ‚ÄúCW visited the campgrounds at Exhibition Park, where thousands have descended upon Canberra to participate in more COVID-19 vaccine mandate protests this weekend. It‚Äôs Friday morning, and from the procession of cars and cacophony of horns, cheering and chants heard outside the main gate at EPIC, add some tyre screeching and you‚Äôd think Summernats had returned to Canberra. Just outside we meet Michael Simms, a Canberra disability worker who, since 15 November 2021, hasn‚Äôt been able to work due to his vaccination status. We jump in a car and are taken on a tour of the expansive campgrounds, where tents, campervans and cars stretch as far as the eye can see. There has been an explosion of campers coming in from across the country this week ahead of large protests planned for Commonwealth Park and Parliament House tomorrow, Saturday 12 January. Once inside, a pervasive sense of warmth and friendliness is immediately noticeable. A festival atmosphere permeates the showgrounds; the mood is upbeat and positive, with crowds of smiling faces lining the streets waving to cars passing by and saying hello to anyone walking past. Being unable to work due to his vaccination status, Mr Simms said his issue lies with the mandates specifically: ‚ÄúMy family are vaccinated, all my friends are vaccinated, all my work colleagues are vaccinated; there‚Äôs no hate there, it‚Äôs just I don‚Äôt want to get it, and I want to go to work,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI can see my work colleagues after work, I can hang out with them on the weekend ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just the fact I can‚Äôt go to work. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my main fight here, the mandates.‚Äù Having been involved with the protests for over a week now, Mr Simms estimates 90 per cent of people he‚Äôs spoken to are skilled professionals who have lost their job over refusing to get a COVID-19 vaccine. ‚ÄúThe Canberra Noticeboard think everyone here is a bum, but most people here worked until not long ago when they lost their jobs. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre schoolteachers, they‚Äôre nurses, they‚Äôre disability workers; they‚Äôre the occupations that have lost their job‚Äù",https://www.facebook.com/MMAMVAUSTRALIA/posts/485575743162859,facebook,PostedOnFacebookActivity

Uncle Max passed from a long-term illness of bronchial asthma/pneumonitis on the 11th of December. He would have been 86 in February. Uncle Max ‚ÄòDulumunmun‚Äô Harrison was an initiated Yuin man. His teachings were passed down to him by 5 masters of Aboriginal Lore. Uncle Max had been on the National Board of Elders, taught at schools and universities and released several books on Aboriginal culture. These include My Peoples Dreaming, and two books to be released next year, Rivers of Kinship and Guruwal Whale Dreaming. Earlier this year, Uncle Max launched world national Kangaroo Day to highlight and preserve our national icon. Uncle Max was a cultural giant and touched everyone with wisdom. In memory of Uncle Max, donations to Back To Country, to continue his cultural work, would be greatly appreciated. WESPAC ACCOUNT NAME: BTC (Back to Country) BSB: 032691 ACC: 513265 There are a number of ceremonies that are being organised for Uncle Max.

2021-10-10T11:41:22Z,"@tays_way__ dropping bombs 4YEARS AGO!!! This popped up in my Facebook memories and definitely needed to be shared. It‚Äôs not just the covid shot people. One in a million‚Ä¶ that is what we are told. It‚Äôs a one in a million chance your child will suffer an adverse reaction to a vaccine. It is very ‚Äúrare‚Äù we are told. Certain reactions are ‚Äúcommon‚Äù and the risks of vaccines are very ‚Äúlow‚Äù. We actually have no idea what the REAL risks are of vaccines because vaccine reactions in Australia (and all over the world) are severely underreported, if reported at all. Parents don‚Äôt even know they can actually report their child‚Äôs adverse reaction themselves. So of course the medical establishment can say that the risks of vaccines are very ‚Äúlow‚Äù when they purposely DO NOT report the reactions on the system. I have had hundreds of parents come forward to me and tell me what has happened to their child after their vaccinations. Every time I ask them ‚Äúdid the doctors report the reaction?‚Äù The answer is always, NO. It is not a one in a million chance of your child reacting to their vaccinations, it is a one in a million chance of your child‚Äôs adverse reaction being reported by the doctors! And when children regress or become severely ill after their shots, the doctors will swear black and blue that it was just a ‚Äúcoincidence‚Äù, it certainly is not linked to the vaccines, that it is normal for children to be sick. Let‚Äôs be clear, vaccine reactions ARE NOT NORMAL. Vaccine reactions ARE NOT RARE. Just take one look at the thousands of signatures of vaccine injured people behind me on the Vaxxed bus. Do not let the medical establishment manipulate your mind and make you think otherwise. They constantly and grossly under exaggerate the true risk of a vaccine reaction. And when a child does have a reaction, they dismiss the parents, make them feel like they are in the wrong for asking questions about their own child‚Äôs health, then wipe their hands clean and leave you to pick up the pieces. There is no accountability, there is no liability. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. üëäüèΩ #vaxxed #learntherisk #bebrave #tays_way_",https://www.facebook.com/MMAMVAUSTRALIA/posts/408766834177084,facebook,PostedOnFacebookActivity

2021-12-10T01:18:00Z,"‚ÄúWith great disappointment I announce my resignation from the Board of Directors at the Adelaide Football Club. The AFL‚Äôs COVID mandate, and the club‚Äôs deeply concerning response to it, has left me with no choice but to step down. Further, I have been increasingly concerned following news that one of Adelaide‚Äôs SANFL players has been diagnosed with pericarditis, a serious heart condition, as a result of taking the COVID vaccination at the direction of the AFL and club. Based on this, I called a special board meeting to urgently discuss the player‚Äôs condition, the health and safety of all of our players and other associated risks. It was clear the board was immovable on this issue and key, reasonable questions are yet to be answered including; -What guidance or direction the AFL has provided the club following notification of the vaccination injury. -What steps the club has taken to review its vaccination policy in light of the incident and any similar events. -Whether the known risks of COVID-19 vaccines were considered when the vaccination policy was adopted and, given the player‚Äôs injury, proposing that the mandatory policy be reviewed as soon as possible. I cannot support a coercive and forceful policy that does not consider the proportionate risk to players and staff. As a Member Elected Director, I cannot support a policy that unfairly discriminates against our highly diverse 60,000 members and over 650,000 fans who have a wide range of personal and medical considerations when it comes to vaccination. The AFL has chosen to enforce its edict. The only option available was to fall into line at the expense of my personal (private) medical circumstances, including my unique health conditions which have been deemed significant by my specialists, and supported by my cardiologist in a request to the club for a medical exemption (which has been denied). I cannot agree to the imposition of that corporate edict on my health, values and convictions, and those of other staff, players and members, despite the personal cost.‚Äù",https://www.facebook.com/MMAMVAUSTRALIA/posts/446539593733141,facebook,PostedOnFacebookActivity

2021-10-23T22:21:31Z,"Current Australian Doctor speaks against mandates. ‚ÄúIt violates every persons right to choose. It violates the statement in the Australian Immunization Handbook produced by The Department of Health and Aging about consent It must be given voluntarily in the abscence of undue pressure,coercion or manipulation as well as the Nuremburg accord which states the same principle. The statement about a Safe and effective immunization is untrue. The medium and long term safety in not known even by the manufacturers so how can anyone make such statements? Equally disgusting is the TGA 's reasoning about use of ivermectin. All debate seems to be suppressed and this seems to be aided by mainstream media. I hope that someday soon we will have an evaluation of all the facts presented without bias.

Elder Bruce Shillingsworth appeared in the ACT Magistrates Court on Thursday (20 January), charged with a count of trespassing on Commonwealth premises. The hearing had a confusing start. When Magistrate Beth Campbell asked if his name was Bruce Shillingsworth, he replied, ‚Äúobjection‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou may call him Bruce of clan Shillingsworth,‚Äù the woman supporting him said. Mr Shillingsworth repeatedly yelled over the top of Magistrate Campbell, including saying there was ‚Äúno jurisdiction‚Äù. While Magistrate Campbell was writing, the woman walked from the gallery to the prosecutor and placed a large folder on the desk in front of her, then walked up to the magistrate and put a similar folder on the bench in front of her. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare!‚Äù Magistrate Campbell yelled at her, knocking the folder off her desk. Police were called and the woman was removed from the courtroom. Mr Shillingsworth continued to yell from the back of the courtroom, including: ‚ÄúLet the record know you have now been served.‚Äù ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt,‚Äù Magistrate Campbell replied. ‚ÄúThis kangaroo court doesn‚Äôt exist on this country,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are the sovereign, original owners on this land. ‚ÄúYou have now been served.‚Äù After being escorted outside, passing a large number of police near the courthouse‚Äôs entry, he was cheered by a crowd of supporters. Magistrate Campbell had said she would enter a not guilty plea to his charge in the absence of him indicating which way he would plead.

No good being diet woke guys. You say you‚Äôre fighting for the kids? How about start actually fighting for the kids. We need to stand up for our children now, it‚Äôs only getting worse. The more the vaccine schedule grows the more Autism rates are climbing, 1-6 kids have learning disabilities, ADHD, more and more kids with allergies.

2021-05-24T02:15:04Z,"Serene Teffaha, from Advocate Me, has been operating a legal practice, as well as an advocacy service. As part of the legal practice, Serene provides specialised legal advice for clients who may need to escalate issues to the Courts, tribunals and/or commissions. Serene has also been operating an advocacy service, where she empowers clients with the knowledge and understanding of their situation, to deescalate their matter and attempt to negotiate a resolution. In that capacity, Serene provides legal information to assist the clients, and for those who are unrepresented she provides pro-bono support as a friend of the Court. ‚Äã Serene has also run various campaigns to create awareness and organise various actions in a lawful manner, to mobilse people with the purpose of creating change. Serene and her team done this through her campaigns such as Cops for Covid Truth, AHPRA Whistleblower complaint, a Peoples' Commissions for the Family Court of Australia, Detention Towers class action and the National Class Action. ‚Äã Unfortunately Serene's campaigns have been very powerful and as a result of her strong representation of people who have suffered human rights breaches and crimes against humanity, the Victorian Legal Services Board ('VLSB') has cancelled Serene's legal practitioner license. They are now threatening not just to force themselves onto the clients of the legal practice, to forcibly attain their legal files without client approval, instruction, knowledge or consent, they are also threatening to take the information that belongs to the campaigns unrelated to the legal practice. ‚Äã We are fighting this battle in the Supreme Court of Victoria, as the VLSB is not only seeking to muzzle Serene as a legal practitioner, but also as an advocate for the people. Given this, we need to re-calibrate our bearings and expose the corruption.

The family travel 7 hours every second month for her child to receive very valuable procedures. They stay the night at Ronald McDonald House before travelling the 7 hours back home. They have always appreciated this government subsidised accommodation, and it‚Äôs so valuable for them to relax the night before making their trip home. As any parent would know,travelling is a nightmare. Travelling with a child with severe Cerebral Palsy makes it that much harder. Not to mention there is no appropriate bathroom facilities anywhere on their journey. The one nights accommodation is really needed. Well today they‚Äôve received a letter stating starting 2022, they will not be able to stay there anymore unless they are vaccinated. Just more heart wrenching coercion added to the mix. If any of our amazing community have, or know of any appropriate places near Brisbane that could help this family out once every 8 weeks please let me know.",https://www.facebook.com/MMAMVAUSTRALIA/posts/420322813021486,facebook,PostedOnFacebookActivity

Each day I‚Äôm going to show gratitude for someone I deeply appreciate and for the work I‚Äôve seen them do. They may have personally helped me, they may have inspired me or may be just a great person - all 3 even üòä Today I‚Äôd like to share my appreciation for Yarraka Bayles With the trials and tribulations this sister has gone through in her own life you couldn‚Äôt blame her if she decided to not speak up and only worry about herself, but she is way too much of a warrior for that. An amazing mother, grandmother, small business owner and activist of many causes Yarraka continues to stand up and fight for what she believes in always. In a family with 4 generations of non vaccinated, she was truely awake to all this before the majority of us. A passionate advocate for medical freedom, human rights, disabilities, and indigenous rights Yarraka not only speaks up for all these issues but also raises amazing awareness for them all. As most of you know, fighting for any of these issues is tough work, fighting for them all is damn near impossible, especially with the shots fired at you from all angles. Racism still exists and although I‚Äôm light skinned and can fly under the radar a lot of the time I‚Äôve still taken shots from black and white for doing what I‚Äôm doing. This must be 100x fold for Yarraka. No offence to anyone but truth be told if I or anyone else stopped advocating today, things would move on the same way. But there is only one Yarraka. What this sister does, nobody else does. We urgently need more brothers and sisters to learn from Yarraka and really help her with this work. She has bridged the gap like nobody before and has opened many peoples eyes to the fact what is happening to us all now, has been happening to our ancestors for over 200 years - and worse. Yarraka no words can describe the love, thanks, respect and appreciation I and many others have for you.",https://www.facebook.com/MMAMVAUSTRALIA/posts/335075391546229,facebook,SharedAPostOnFacebookActivity

2021-07-01T03:47:41Z,"NEW QUEENSLAND BILL EXTENDS EMERGENCY POWERS TO 30 APRIL 2022 ‚ÄúIMPORTANT PLEASE SHARE PETITION LINK https://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/work-of-assembly/petitions/petition-details?id=3576 On 16 June 2021, right in the middle of ‚ÄòBudget Week‚Äô, the Minister for Health, Yvette D‚ÄôAth, tabled a new Bill extending the Public Health Emergency Response measures from 30 September 2021 to 30 April 2022. The Public Health and Other Legislation (Further Extension of Expiring Provisions) Amendment Bill 2021 extends a range of emergency measures, including the extraordinary powers of the Chief Health Officer, Dr Jeannette Young. These powers include the ability to impose restrictions on the free movement of citizens, their ability to travel, conduct a business, attend school, church or sport, as well as the power to issue mandates on mask wearing, social distancing rules, the numbers of persons who can gather at any one time, border closures, area lockdowns and quarantine mandates. The Bill also extends emergency measures, and creates new ones, for the care of mental health patients and persons with cognitive or intellectual disability, the operation of prisons and youth detention centres and related measures. As far as I have been able to tell, no mention of the Bill, its contents or tabling last Wednesday has received a single mention in the media or state legal bodies. This is surprising. By 30 April 2022, Queenslanders will have been living under ‚Äòstate of emergency‚Äô conditions for more than two years, with every chance the date will be extended yet again, judging on past experience. This is something that warrants public discussion, if not debate, I would have thought. From the time Queenslanders were first told we needed a ‚Äòshort, sharp lockdown‚Äô to ‚Äòflatten the curve‚Äô, the Government has released no ‚Äòexit strategy‚Äô or ‚Äòroadmap‚Äô for a way out of the current ‚Äòemergency‚Äô conditions ‚Äì an ‚Äòemergency‚Äô which many agree, is starting to look ominously permanent. The Bill was referred to the Health Committee by the Minister in the Speech, however it appears the Bill did not go to the Health Committee, of which I am a member, but appears instead on the list for the Economics and Governance Committee. The Committee is due to report back to Parliament by 6 August 2021, and has called for submissions on the Bill by 5pm on Wednesday 7 July 2021, so only a week from today. I hope as many people as possible will lodge a submission on the Bill, if for no other reason than to let the Government know that some Queenslanders ARE still paying attention, and even some who continue to believe in out-dated democratic principles like the need for public debate, transparency and accountable government. Send your submission to Email: egc@parliament.qld.gov.au Or Post to: Committee Secretary Economics and Governance Committee Parliament House George Street Brisbane Qld 4000 Submissions must include: ‚Ä¢ your Full name ‚Ä¢ at least two of the following: o mailing address o email address o daytime telephone number.

2021-12-31T21:58:56Z,"I don‚Äôt have it in me to do some big motivational New Years post. Let‚Äôs be real, 2022 is probably going to be even worse than 2021. In 2021 I lost my job of 12 years and career of 18. Not one former work colleague was there for any support, to have my back, or fight for me in the slightest. In 2021 I lost my father. No words can be said. In 2021 I also lost a valuable First Nations elder who led my Sydney rallies and was involved in many of our meetings as a cultural advisor. In 2021 I lost hope numerous times, and numerous times people I had met on these platforms picked me up, held me up and had my back. I now consider many of you my real friends. We‚Äôve been through a lot together, and never did you sway. I‚Äôve been lucky enough and honoured to have met many of you at our events in 2021 and that is what I treasure. When I lost my father you all reached out. When I lost my job you all reached out. You constantly encouraged and motivated, bringing love and hope. So coming into 2022 I‚Äôd like to thank all the people that were ‚Äústrangers‚Äù to me, yet stood strong by my side. To all the people that are still strangers, thank you! To the people who have bumped into me or sent messages of support. THANK YOU!! To the people who have become amazing friends. THANK YOU!!

2021-03-17T00:37:32Z,"Court Decision - July 2017 - Vaccines can cause SIDS IV. CONCLUSION In this case, I have concluded, after review of the evidence, that it is more likely than not that the vaccines played a substantial causal role in the death of XXX without the effect of which he would not have died. The role of inflammatory cytokines as neuro-modulators in the infant medulla has been well described and is likely the reason for a significant number of SIDS deaths occurring in conjunction with mild infection. I have concluded that it is more likely than not that the vaccine-stimulated cytokines had the same effect in this vulnerable infant during sleep. Take that in for a minute. SIDS = Vaccination Death SIDS is 100% death from vaccination....saying otherwise is the equivalent of wearing a sign that says, I have no critical thinking skills whatsoever. SIDS is an invention of the medical field, which literally means Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. The study of SIDS cases reveals these deaths are clustered in and around vaccination times. The medical system declares that although it doesn't know what causes SIDS, it's sure it ISN'T the vaccines. Make sense? Of course it doesn't. All this of course happening while each vaccine insert lists death or conditions associated with death as side effects. So just to recap the logic. The cause of SIDS is unknown but they know it's not the vaccine, even though the vaccine insert admits death can result. Awakening can be painful but it's better than the alternative. Thinking won't cost you a thing....repeating the lies you've been fed might cost you everything. OK, now revisit SIDS, which happens to occur predominately around vaccination. Now we know the US has the highest day of birth infant mortality in the industrial world. After day of birth SIDS decreases until the largest spike and most frequent occurences happen at 2,4, and 6 months of the infants life. Hmm....what events happen at 2,4, and 6 months?? Think harder.... The peak age for SIDS is 2,4, and 6 months, which coincides with the introduction of wellness checks, which are an invented ritual where you allow your newborn to be injected with a few dozen toxic as holy hell vaccines. The US currently sits 58th in infant mortality...but it's anything but the vaccines Right? A 2011 study published in Human & Experimental Toxicology, for instance, observed that ‚ÄúThe US childhood immunization schedule specifies 26 vaccine doses for infants aged less than 1 year‚Äîthe most in the world‚Ä¶yet 33 nations have lower IMRs [infant mortality rates].‚Äù They found that across the 34 nations analyzed ‚Äúa high statistically significant correlation between increasing number of vaccine doses and increasing infant mortality rates.‚Äù http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0960327111407644 Also, a recent study published in Vaccine titled, ‚ÄúCo-administration of live measles and yellow fever vaccines and inactivated pentavalent vaccines is associated with increased mortality compared with measles and yellow fever vaccines only‚Äù found multiple infant vaccines dramatically increased the risk of mortality in a trial conducted in the West African country of Guinea-Bissau. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24325827# Another study found, ‚ÄùThe case fatality was increased for children who had received DTP with or after measles vaccine compared with children who had received measles vaccine as the most recent vaccine‚Äù https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17092614# A new study published in Current Medicine and Chemistry titled, ‚ÄúSudden infant death following hexavalent vaccination: a neuropathologic study,‚Äù lends support for the long theorized link between an ever-expanding number of infant vaccines and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). http://www.eurekaselect.com/115921/article Given the number of ‚Äòantigenic‚Äô exposures in vaccines, singularly, and in multi-dose form, the number of possible immunological reactions in newborns is simply mind-blowing especially considering just how little we know about the immune system, the developing brain and infant physiology. In 2011, a study was published in Statistics in Medicine titled ‚ÄúA modified self-controlled case series method to examine association between multidose vaccinations and death,‚Äù found that based on the review of 300 unexplained sudden unexpected deaths (uSUD) following either penta- or hexavalent, ‚Äúa 16-fold risk increase after the 4th dose could be detected with a power of at least 90 per cent,‚Äù and ‚ÄúA general 2-fold risk increase after vaccination could be detected with a power of 80 per cent.‚Äù https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21337361 Another 2011 study published in PLoS titled ‚ÄúSudden unexpected deaths and vaccinations during the first two years of life in Italy: a case series study,‚Äù investigated a signal of an association between vaccination in the second year of life with a hexavalent vaccine and sudden unexpected deaths (SUD) in the two day window following vaccination, which was reported in Germany in 2003. The Italian study sought to establish whether hexavalent vaccines increased the short-term risk of SUD in infants. The study analyzed 604 infants who died of SUD, 244 (40%) of whom had received at least one vaccination. Four deaths occurred within two days from vaccination with the hexavalent vaccines, representing a 50% increase in relative risk. The relative risk for SUD for the risk periods 0-7 and 0-14 days were 100% [2.0 RR] and 50% [1.5 RR] higher, respectively. The study concluded that there was a 120% [2.2 RR] increased risk associated with the first dose of hexavalent vaccine. http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016363 One of the first studies to offer an explanation was published in 2006 in the international journal of pathology, Virchows Archives titled, ‚ÄúSudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) shortly after hexavalent vaccination: another pathology in suspected SIDS?‚Äú. The study discussed how previous expert analysis performed by the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products in 2003, following an investigation they conducted into the emergence of a link between hexavalent vaccines and 5 cases of infant deaths that occurred, paid little attention ‚Äúto examination of the brainstem and the cardiac conduction systems on serial sections, nor was the possibility of a triggering role of the vaccine in these deaths considered.‚Äù The study goes on to report on the autopsy findings of a 3-month old female infant who died suddenly and unexpectedly immediately after the administration of the hexavalent vaccine. The autopsy revealed ‚ÄúThe cardiac conduction system presented persistent fetal dispersion and resorptive degeneration.‚Äù The author hypothesized, ‚ÄúThe unexpected death of this vulnerable baby (infant with bilateral hypoplasia of the arcuate nucleus) could have been triggered by the hexavalent vaccination. This case is consistent with the triple-risk model of SIDS, a hypothesis comprising an underlying biological vulnerability to exogenous stressors and some triggering factors in a critical developmental period.‚Äù https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16231176 Another case study published in Forensic Science International in 2008 titled, ‚ÄúBeta-tryptaseand quantitative mast-cell increase in a sudden infant death following hexavalent immunization,‚Äù described a fatal case of a 3-month-old female infant, who died within 24 h of vaccination with hexavalent vaccine from vaccine-induced shock. They concluded:‚Äú‚Ä¶that acute respiratory failure likely due to post hexavalent immunization-related shock was the cause of death.‚Äù https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24083600/?i=2&from=sids%20vaccine About 11,300 newborns die within 24 hours of their birth in the U.S. each year, 50 percent more first-day deaths than all other industrialized countries combined, the report's authors stated http://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-has-highest-first-day-infant-mortality-out-of-industrialized-world-group-reports/ They will come up with a variety of excuses for this...anything to point the finger at mothers and other factors and take the focus away from the shots. The birth day hep B shot and synthetic vitamin K shot.....Both of which are done in the US on the day of birth within hours and both are linked to a number of adverse reactions including SIDS. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-has-highest-first-day-infant-mortality-out-of-industrialized-world-group-reports/ Do I have your attention yet? Ask yourself why most people have no idea these studies exist and why the media never reports on any of this including our embarrassing infant mortality rate. We have a society that has been covering up infant deaths for several decades so they can profit from vaccination. SIDS was so rare before vaccination started you won't even find it mentioned. The choice is yours...start thinking and let's save the children by making everyone aware of the information or continue to do nothing and pretend this isn't happening, which makes you an accessory to this immoral and evil society.",https://www.facebook.com/MMAMVAUSTRALIA/posts/275141757539593,facebook,SharedAPostOnFacebookActivity

But you‚Äôve frightened these parents who aren‚Äôt interested in the slightest of looking at any data, into rushing out and making their child and experimental lab rat. . Parents please know this.

The doctors will tell you it. They will send you home with some Panadol and a lifeless child saying they don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong‚Ä¶.. but it‚Äôs not the vaccine.

But also filled with love, hope and respect. For a long time Meryl and the AVN were your first, last and only call of assistance with V-injury, V-awareness and V- education. Thank you Meryl for being that pioneer and never giving up. Not only have you personally helped so many families, you have helped build and encourage so many leaders. Without you leading the way and showing us we could all speak out, things may be much different today. I‚Äôve been honoured to have Meryl interview me twice (the first was my first live ever), the privilege to have met her in person and humbled to have interviewed her. Although sad to see Meryl taking a step back, what she has done will never be forgotten.

I wasted half my life working for people who didn‚Äôt even try to keep me employed. 7. The media is able to control every mind that watches it with lies and manipulation. 8. Most people lack any logical thinking, and don‚Äôt want the truth. 9. I stand beside, in front of, and behind some of the most wonderful, brilliant, strong warriors who will never give up the fight for themselves, their families, and mine. 10.

Don‚Äôt use the words starting with Pf, Mo or Va, as I don‚Äôt want the algoxxxxms to find me üôèüèªüòá I need to add that I only survived the first days and weeks of this because of my selfless true friends, Caitlins friends, and my darling boys and their friends. You know who you are. I love you xxx At the risk of upsetting people, I‚Äôm going to post here, publicly, what happened to Caitlin. Feel free to make your own assumptions about why she died. And share. Caitlin was tall, strong, fit, muscular and hardworking. Her 6 day a week job entailed 20 km per day walking two year old thoroughbred racehorses and manual work. She died at work, on shift. Please share for Caitlin. My beautiful, vibrant, healthy and fit daughter, Caitlin, died on Wednesday 17th November 2021. Her horrific death at work, was preceded by three weeks of illness immediately following her second mandated (by Qld Racing) inoculation. On the day, events unfolded like this: Mum who lives an hour from Toowoomba, received a message from Caitlins boss saying to get to her work urgently. Caitlin had stopped breathing and the ambulance were with her. Mum called Caitlin‚Äôs brothers, not knowing that Caitlin was already long dead. 20 year old and 15 year old brothers reached Caitlin half hour before mum. She looked perfect. Yet dead on the footpath. Head in the gutter. Needle in her heart. Tube down her throat. Vomit all over the inside of her car, which we had to drive home ourselves. Police all around, yet race goers walking past her. Hundreds of cars and rubberneckers driving past her. For hours. Here is a timeline leading up to this day, and since. (Information taken directly from Caitlin‚Äôs text messages - legal and true. No assumptions in this timeline). 6th September 2021 - Monday o Caitlin received Pfizer injection approximately midday, at Hospital vaccination clinic. 18th September 2021 - Saturday o Very tired and needing sleep 28th September 2021 - Tuesday o Received second Pfizer injection 29th September 2021 - Wednesday o Caitlin very ill from side effects 30th September 2021 - Thursday o Caitlin very ill from side effects o Caitlin concerned about length of her vaccine side effects. o Too tired and sick to go shopping for food. o Texted work mates telling them she was so sick from the covid shot she could not go to work. 1st October 2021 - Friday o Caitlin very ill from side effects 2nd October 2021 ‚Äì Saturday o Caitlin very ill from side effects 5th October 2021 - Tuesday o Caitlin‚Äôs personality began to change ‚Äì cranky 9th October 2021 - Saturday o Caitlin not well enough to help with cattle mustering and drafting. 11th October 2021 - Monday o Texted asking how she can get some Ventolin. o Caitlin stated she has had ‚Äúallergies enough to need Zyrtec these last couple weeks and a little asthma every now and again. 21st October 2021 - Thursday o Caitlin asking for privacy. Very stressed from being ill 13th November 2021 - Saturday o Caitlin was with friends in the evening when she suddenly couldn‚Äôt breathe. She left and drove herself to the Toowoomba Base Hospital where she was treated for asthma o The ECG monitor in her selfie photo shows a flat line. 14th November 2021 - Sunday o Caitlin was discharged from the Toowoomba Base Hospital in the early hours of the morning and went home to bed. o Medications prescribed were antibiotics, steroids, preventer and reliever inhalers o Caitlin texted ‚ÄúHas (brothers) asthma been any worse lately?,,,I had an asthma attack out of the blue last night and went to the hospital for it. Had a bit of asthma a few weeks ago when I was a bit sick with a bit of sinus congestion. That‚Äôs it. Havent had a preventer in years. Hospital gave me script for inhaler and steroids‚Ä¶Fluticasone inhaler. And prednisolone tablets. o Caitlin too ill to attend work and stayed in bed 15th November 2021 - Monday o Extremely upset about issues at work with her boss not believing she was sick and making her work extra hours o Caitlin stated that the Covid vaccine had made her sick o Caitlin attended a GP appointment with her doctor of 15 years ‚Äì no further action 16th November 2021 ‚Äì Tuesday o Final notification from Queensland Racing that from tomorrow Friday 17th November, all Qld Race meetings are fully vaccinated events. 17th November 2021 - Wednesday o Caitlin worked both morning and afternoon shifts. o Around 3:30pm, whilst on shift, Caitlin walked out the front door of the stables to her car. o Staff knew Caitlin had gone to her car. They stated they thought she was cranky, or taking a phone call. They stated they gave her time alone. o In her car it appears she tried to take her asthma puffer through her spacer. o Caitlin died. o Closer to 4pm Caitlin‚Äôs workmates decided to get her from her car. Caitlin was sitting in drivers seat and had collapsed into the passenger seat. There was vomit everywhere. Staff stated she felt no warmth in Caitlin‚Äôs body. o Staff went inside and called another workmate who came out and removed Caitlin‚Äôs body from the car onto the sidewalk. He began CPR. A passer-by then took over CPR. At some stage an ambulance was called. o Caitlin‚Äôs mother received the first message from boss at 4:26pm, to return her call. Didn‚Äôt find out caitlin was dead until an hour later when arrived at scene. o Two days later Caitlins body was transferred John Tonge Centre in Brisbane for bloodwork and scans. o Two days later Forensic pathologist requested to do an autopsy o Three days later forensic pathologist advised mother that they found no cause for Caitlins death except she had an enlarged heart and her lungs we‚Äôre overinflated, which he said was most likely from all the CPR she received. Forensic pathologist said lungs did not show signs of asthma. o Took tissue samples of heart and lungs for histology o Coroner advised via forensic pathologist that histology would take six months and a a cause may never be found, and the family needs to be prepared for the conclusion of ‚ÄúUNDETERMINED‚Äù as a cause of death. o 1st of December 2021 Caitlin was laid to rest. WH&S have said I to not their jurisdiction and have given a referral to the Health Ombudsman, for consideration of an investigation. The reason I am making this public, is because I do not accept Caitlin died of UNDETERMINED causes. I hope to pressure the Coroner into making a true and correct report, in a timely manner. I hope to then take this further and bring the people responsible for the unfathomable loss of my darling girl, to justice.

Tay has been educating and empowering people about informed consent, way back before the majority ever knew this would be an issue for them. Many of our community leaders and activists of today, gained their insight and confidence by watching and learning from Tay - whether directly or indirectly - and seeing her knowledge, strength, and passion drive through consistently even with the biggest of critics around. It may be easy for some to overlook but it was Tay building this movement back before anyone knew we needed it, empowering parents and future parents for this very moment in time. For that we can‚Äôt thank Tay enough, and also for her consistent support of our marches. We look forward to Tay and the @nsw_freedomkeepers community bringing their amazing vibes again on the 27th November at Hyde Park. #mmamv #freedomkeepersunited #taysway #reclaimtheline",https://www.facebook.com/MMAMVAUSTRALIA/posts/434032551650512,facebook,PostedOnFacebookActivity

2021-12-23T20:07:32Z,"Thinking of everyone struggling with grief especially at this time of year, it is important to remember that not everyone is looking forward to Christmas. Some people are not surrounded by large wonderful families. Some of us have problems during the holidays and are overcome with great sadness when we remember the loved ones who are not with us. For many it is their first Christmas without a particular loved one and many others lost loved ones at Christmas. Many people have no one to spend these times with and are besieged by loneliness ‚ù§ We all need caring, loving thoughts right now. May I ask my friends, wherever you might be, to give a moment of support to all those who have family problems, health struggles, job issues, worries of any kind and just need to know that someone cares.

2021-09-06T21:53:17Z,"Senior Constable Belinda Hocroft, who is attached the Dog and Mounted Police unit, has filed a legal action against NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard arguing she is not an anti-vaxxer but she is concerned about the long term effects of the vaccine and does not want to receive it. Ms Hocroft‚Äôs lawyer Charly Tannous from Sage Solicitors said the action challenges the Minister‚Äôs right to require people in the affected LGAs to be vaccinated before they can leave the area and the test case is likely to affect thousands of workers. ‚ÄúThis case will consider the extent to which the Government may coerce its citizens to have themselves injected with a drug they object to taking, especially when there is a less intrusive alternative of having the unvaccinated citizens tested to ensure that they are not carrying the virus.‚Äù Ms Hocroft, who has been a police officer for 14 years said she has been told she cannot return to work unless she has the first jab because she is from a hot spot zone. ‚ÄúI am not against vaccines as such. However I am concerned about the long term effects of Covid-19 given they are relatively new vaccines,‚Äù Ms Hocroft said in an affidavit to support her legal action. ‚ÄúI am the mother of four young children between the ages of three years old and seven years old and I am concerned about the potential negative/long term effects that any new vaccine may have on my health and by extension the health and welfare of my family.‚Äù ‚ÄúI am concerned the NSW Government is giving me an ultimatum by forcing me to take the vaccine otherwise (I) will become unemployed,‚Äù she said.",https://www.facebook.com/MMAMVAUSTRALIA/posts/387223789664722,facebook,SharedAPostOnFacebookActivity

2021-12-30T12:26:03Z,"MILLIONS MARCH AGAINST MANDATORY VACCINATIONS #MMAMV PRESS RELEASE ‚Äì THURSDAY 30 December 2021 FIRE AT OLD PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA At approximately 1130am Thursday 30 December 2021, a fire broke out at the front door of Old Parliament House, Canberra during an event. Some mainstream media and social media representatives have reported that Millions March Against Mandatory Vaccinations (MMAMV) Australia claimed responsibility for the fire. This claim is entirely false. MMAMV did not start this fire, neither has it ever claimed that MMAMV was responsible for the fire, nor for the organisation of the event. MMAMV representative Michael Simms was attending and live streaming the event at 1130am Thursday 30 December when the fire broke out. Michael was wearing an orange vest with 'media' on the back, which had been given to him by First Nations representatives to indicate he had permission to film the ceremonies. Michael has been attending these events to spend time with First Nation Elders to learn their history and traditions. The focus of their talks has been on how to unite people ‚Äì overcoming entrenched and unnecessary divisions, including of colour, race, politics, religion ‚Äì to stand together with the original owners of this land. Michael posted his livestream on the MMAMVAustralia Facebook page platform to educate his community on First Nation issues. This post was then shared widely. We invite members of the media to rectify any inaccurate reports they may have made in error, and to refer to MMAMV without bias, and to avoid inflammatory and defamatory terms such as ‚Äòanti-vaxxer,‚Äô ‚Äòconspiracy theorist,‚Äô 'far right,' ‚Äòextremist,‚Äô and ‚Äòdangerous.‚Äô We are none of these things. We are normal Australians asking questions, standing for basic human rights, and caring about the needs of our community. MMAMV is a grassroots community, volunteer-run organisation, standing up for human rights, medical freedom, informed consent, freedom of speech and truth and transparency. Michael has offered his MMAMV platform to First Nations Elders to help share their message of unity. MMAMV has organised events in Australia for its community of vaccine injured people and the families of people lost to vaccine injury since 2019. Our MMAMV rallies are always peaceful, family-friendly and police approved, and we welcome anyone who has any interest or concern about any aspect of their family's health. Here is Bruce Shillingsworth with the message he would like to put out.

Per the New York mandate cited by the league Wednesday, as of Sept. 13 anyone over the age of 12 entering a public facility such as a sports arena or other ‚Äúindoor gyms and fitness settings‚Äù in the city must present proof of at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. That includes players, and in the case of the Nets it would also cover possible entrance to their practice facility in Brooklyn. The Knicks practice outside the city at a facility in Westchester County. Warriors players both practice and play at their arena complex in San Francisco. That city‚Äôs ordnance, which will take effect Oct. 13, requires full vaccination for anyone 12 and older to attend any indoor event with over 1,000 guests. The league also warned that Knicks, Nets or Warriors players who choose not to get vaccinated could be considered to be failing to provide services called for by their contracts. As such, those players could be subject to fines, suspensions and/or possible reductions in salary. Although the vaccine itself is not mandatory for NBA players, the league has also put in other rules to make it life harder for the unvaccinated. Unvaccinated players can‚Äôt play for a week if they‚Äôve come into contact with someone with covid, vaccinated players can still play. Unvaccinated players will be segregated in the locker room with their stalls as far away as possible from the vaccinated. Unvaccinated players can not sit in the same section as the vaccinated players while travelling by plane or bus. Other such rules as who can and can‚Äôt go out for such things as dinner also exist.",https://www.facebook.com/MMAMVAUSTRALIA/posts/384929799894121,facebook,SharedAPostOnFacebookActivity

Being involved in a multitude of other rallies, and events in Australia. Im just someone who‚Äôs filled numerous petitions and sent a bunch of letters to politicians. Too many meetings in Australia and abroad to count. Connecting as many people daily as I can with either people that can try to help them, or simply to unite people with other likeminded folk. Fighting and standing everyday for the last 18 months even when compared to others, my situation was fine (no crazy lockdowns and had a secure job).

I‚Äôve done all I can and I‚Äôve given my all, and this is definitely not a ‚Äúretirement speech‚Äù - well in some sense it may be. Im also a disability worker, and have been for approx 17 years.

This isn‚Äôt a sob story either; since day 1 I knew this time was coming, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve fought since day one.

2021-11-01T08:07:26Z,"‚Ä¢ For 18 months the Prime Minister promised that vaccines would not be mandatory, while at the same time pursuing legislative changes that were necessary to make them mandatory. ‚Ä¢ The Prime Minister lied to the Australian people and the proof is in the legislation his government passed through Parliament with the help of the Labor and National Parties. The legislation was called the Australian Immunisation Register Amendment (Reporting) Bill 2020, that the large parties waived through in February this year. This bill allowed the Federal Government to share people‚Äôs vaccination status with the states, so the states could include that in the QR code check- in apps. ‚Ä¢ That was an endgame around privacy laws that prevent businesses and employers from asking people‚Äôs medical status. Now governments won‚Äôt have to because the government will automatically tell them right there on the check-in screen under that big green tick for all to see. ‚Ä¢ Prime Minister Morrison is personally responsible for the vaccine mandates, and so is Anthony Albanese and the Nationals who waived that bill through. ‚Ä¢ Some employers forced injections on employees without evidence of the injection‚Äôs contents and/or possible adverse effects. ‚Ä¢ Some union bosses blindly agreed to not defend union members against mandatory injections. ‚Ä¢ This raises many questions: o Doesn‚Äôt this mean-that Victoria‚Äôs own order to mandate is illegal? o How can consent be freely given when someone is told their job and family's livelihood depends on them agreeing? Particularly when the alternative to an injection is starvation and starvation of one‚Äôs family and children? o How can a pregnant mother be forced or even coerced into being injected when the effect on the baby she is carrying is unknown and simply so that she can continue to feed the toddlers she already has at her feet? o Is it considered that consent has been given when Victorian police stifle protesters voices? And do so with brutality after that state‚Äôs Premier invokes counter-terrorism legislation that leads to innocent people‚Äôs heads being slammed into concrete and to women being choked? o Aregovernmentsawarethatdedicatedaged-careworkersarecryingbecausetheywillresign rather than be injected, and are upset about leaving their residents and patients? o Are governments aware that some and apparently many doctors and nurse assess the injection as being of greater risk than the virus? ‚Ä¢ Isn‚Äôt it immoral that the Commonwealth and the States are forcing injections against people‚Äôs will when: o Vaccinated people transmit the virus? o Vaccinated people have low levels of protection soon after the injection? o Israel is the highest vaccinated nation with a population comparable to NSW, yet virus infection cases are occurring at 10,000 per day. ‚Ä¢ What is the purpose of prizes and benefits given to people who are injected? Isn‚Äôt this a form of coercion, particularly when governments first remove basic human rights and freedom with a promise to return these to those who are double-injected? ‚Ä¢ Separation of society into two opposing groups is an element of classic propaganda and a feature of those who seek to divide to control. Dividing society undermines our strength as a cohesive society. Instead, it is far more effective to get a choice of tested, proven strong protections and let people choose. Coercion fails and undermines people‚Äôs confidence in government. Isn‚Äôt it an effective leader‚Äôs role to unite, inspire and draw people forward, that is to lead? Isn‚Äôt the role of threatening, intimidating, dividing, and coercing that of a bully? ‚Ä¢ Are governments aware that many citizens, whom we are supposed to serve as their representative in parliament, see the federal government present activity in coercing injections as medical tyranny and medical apartheid? ‚Ä¢ What is the scientific basis for implicitly or explicitly strongly demonising the unvaccinated as a threat to the vaccinated? ‚Ä¢ Doesn‚Äôt saying that the unvaccinated threaten the vaccinated mean the injections are not effective? ‚Ä¢ The state and federal governments‚Äô carefully crafted narratives contain many blatant contradictions and despicably false claims and slogans. Why have governments resorted to using such measures against the people they are supposed to serve? Rather than seeing these as signs of care, people are rightly seeing these as symptoms of control. ‚Ä¢ State governments have repeatedly shifted the goal posts on injection proportions: Initially the goal was stated as 70% double injected, then 80%, and recently the Queensland Premier alluded to deeming it 90%. Meanwhile Britain, with 80% double injected, is having a large increase in cases. What is governments‚Äô stated goal or range of goals and what is the specific science upon which such advice and goals are based? Where is the scientific publication title, author(s) name(s) and specific location of the empirical scientific data and the causal logical framework proving cause-and-effect. ‚Ä¢ If state and federal governments really care about people‚Äôs health, they would not be threatening the doctors, nurses and carers and aged care workers out of service as is currently the case in Queensland. Why is the state government doing this? Why is the federal government urging and supporting state governments that do this? ‚Ä¢ How can it be effective management of health staff, nurses and doctors and aged care carers who we all recognised as heroes for their work on COVID-19 over the last 19 months and to now punish these workers, to cut staff, and to work the remainder to the bone and then asked to be on standby when those refusing injections were stood down? ‚Ä¢ So-called ‚Äúvaccine passports‚Äù lock people out of society and the economy and therefore are more accurately labelled ‚Äúinjection prisons‚Äù. What is the science underpinning this? Where is the title of the scientific paper, author(s) name(s) and page numbers for the data and the logical framework proving cause-and-effect. ‚Ä¢ Will tax refunds be given to members of our community locked out of services they provide through paying taxes and be locked out of access to the community? ‚Ä¢ Are governments aware that businesses are already publicly refusing to enforce injection prisons and at considerable cost to themselves staying closed while separation is in place? ‚Ä¢ Are governments aware that recent public protests, social media, and newspaper articles show that many vaccinated people think coercion is wrong and that restoring basic human rights and freedom has become a core issue for the public and voters? ‚Ä¢ A constituent says, quote: ‚ÄúI was doing OK until they stopped me from working, earning a living because of the mandated vax.‚Äù Are governments aware that vaccine injection mandates are causing enormous stress and mental health problems directly due to the coercion, loss of employment income and the injection‚Äôs adverse effects, and indirectly through the worry of adverse effects among injected people. ‚Ä¢ When a farmer in western Queensland under dry weather conditions has to drive interstate to obtain hay to feed his cattle, he is under instruction to be injected if he wants to re-enter Queensland. ‚Ä¢ Nurses say that one of their primary functions is to ensure patients give informed consent to medical treatments and procedures, yet nurses are denied the same human rights themselves and are instead coerced against their will, beliefs and rights into being injected. ‚Ä¢ Nurses advise that AHPRA has reportedly threatened doctors and nurses to endorse vaccine injections without first giving these health care professionals the training to advocate for the injections. ‚Ä¢ When state governments dismiss health staff who refuse to be injected, state governments are jeopardising health care and risking the lives of patients and future patients. ‚Ä¢ Why is the federal Health Department and Services Australia involved in establishing and running a ‚Äúvaccine passport‚Äù (injection prison) system so that the states can enforce injections? In enabling the states to mandate injections, isn‚Äôt the Commonwealth government in breach of S51, clause 23A of our national constitution? The government‚Äôs circular illogic is astounding and glossed over publicly and in the media. For example, we are told that people not injected need to be forced to be injected using the injections that do not protect the ijected. In effect, the so-called ‚Äúprotected‚Äù need to be protected from the unprotected‚Äù. When fear prevails, the data and logic are bypassed and overrun.

2021-07-09T10:57:32Z,"Linda Burns received her AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine early last month. Not long after, she began feeling ill with a nose bleed, sore throat, cough and headache. Her GP told her to go to hospital. Three days later she was admitted to St John of God in Midland then transferred to Royal Perth where she suffered a brain bleed. The Therapeutic Goods Administration today confirmed her death was likely linked to the vaccine. This was based on the lack of strong evidence for other causes and the occurrence of the event being within a plausible time period after vaccination, the TGA said. She had a severe case of immune thrombocytopenia or ITP - a rare bleeding disorder. The health regulator estimates the risk of ITP is just one case per 100,000 AstraZeneca doses. Experts have repeatedly told Australians that the possibility of developing any life-threatening reaction to the vaccine is vanishingly small. Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare bleeding disorder that occurs when the immune system mistakenly destroys platelets, which helps the blood to clot. It can occur after the immune system is activated, for example by a viral infection or vaccination, and has been reported with other vaccines for hepatitis B, measles, mumps, rubella and influenza. Preliminary findings from a recent Scottish study estimate the risk of ITP to be about one case per 100,000 AstraZeneca doses. To July 4, 2021, the TGA has received 36 reports of suspected ITP. We encourage people to seek medical attention if they experience signs and symptoms that could suggest ITP, such as unusual skin bruising or clusters of small red or purple spots that do not lose their colour when pressed, the TGA said. Unusual bleeding is another sign, for example bleeding from the nose or mouth that is hard to stop, or blood in the urine or stools. In the past week, three confirmed incidents of the rare blood clotting condition TTS have been linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine, along with four classed as probable.",https://www.facebook.com/MMAMVAUSTRALIA/posts/348627100191058,facebook,SharedAPostOnFacebookActivity

2021-11-15T21:00:20Z,"My thoughts and love go to everyone that this mandate is affecting here in Australia. As you go about your business today I endeavor you to approach every situation you encounter with kindness. I endeavor you to look at every person you meet and share a kind gesture, as those people and their lives are changing forever. For reasons you may not understand, you may go to your doctor's practice tomorrow to find your gp of 20 years is no longer there. You may arrive at school drop off to find the teacher that has worked so hard to help your child find their place in the world is no longer there. You may attend your lawyers appointment to find you have been assigned someone who knows nothing about your case because your family lawyer is no longer there. You may arrive at your midwife appointment to realize there is actually no one available to care for you because your midwife along with many others, are no longer there. You may arrive at your grandma's aged care facility to find the nurse that would sit and read her favorite books to her is...no longer there. You may arrive to your kindergarten drop off to find the head ECE teacher, the one who supported you through that tough and challenging times is.... no longer there. . You may run into a friend or former work college that looks distant or depressed as they‚Äôve just lost their job and don‚Äôt know how they will keep a roof over their heads. See as you go about your business in the coming days there are thousands and thousands of PEOPLE, thousands and thousands of HUMANS, that for reasons that are NOBODY'S BUSINESS, are facing the last days of a career they worked for years to obtain. Whatever your belief, profession, religion, race, socioeconomic stand point in life, the world needs some extra kindness. Hold humility, humanity and kindness in your heart today. You don't have to understand someone's decision to respect it, and one day I assure you, one of those people listed above who's career was ripped out from under them like a dirty carpet...you‚Äôre going to need them, just as desperately as they needed you...to be kind. #justbekind #freedomkeepers #freedomkeepersunited #mmamv #reclaimtheline Lara Reid",https://www.facebook.com/MMAMVAUSTRALIA/posts/431861745200926,facebook,SharedAPostOnFacebookActivity
2021-07-15T00:36:55Z,"Welcome to Australia. Where you take your kids to a sporting match and all you see is advertising for fast food, alcohol and gambling. Where there is a McDonald‚Äôs in a children‚Äôs hospital. Where it‚Äôs good to be bad, but bad to be good. Where you can inject a newborn with hundreds of viruses and neurotoxins and contaminants and be okay, but if you say that's wrong or even begin to question it, you're a crazy person. Where people wear masks even when driving in their own car by themselves. Sitting in a room without the tv on is weird, because people can no longer handle flat line emotions, everything needs to be overstimulating all the time. Tv on, phone in hand, and thoughts... Nonexistent. Where you can get candy and fast food easier and cheaper than good food and clean water. Eating healthy is classified as a mental disorder by psychologists. Boobs are okay on commercials and music videos, but people cover the children's eyes if they see someone breastfeeding. Where fluoride is considered a neurotoxin on one hand and on the other it helps prevent cavities. Where doctors are trusted and worshipped like gods, yet never make anyone better. Where cures don't exist for anything and the cause doesn't matter, because the people that sell your medication and sponsor the doctors actually make more money if you‚Äôre sick. Where you‚Äôre told to not go outside and to wear a mask if you do, just so you don‚Äôt pass something you don‚Äôt have to someone who‚Äôs wearing a mask to not pass something to you that they don‚Äôt have. Where government leaders get all the benefits and their wages keep going up while the rest of us struggle, yet we still let them make decisions for us. The majority of conversation is dictated by what was on the latest and greatest TV show and sports events, or gossiping like you're in school. People are killing each other over money that has no value, and people are killing themselves with their every day choices. You'll find people actually believe they're better than others because of their race, religion, or country, when all of these things weren't even chosen by them, but given. You'll see people who can't keep a day job but think they could run the country. Using herbs and positive energy to heal yourself is weird, but taking expensive drugs with a million side effects, that doesn't even help, isnt. I could go on, but you get the point. Society has been flipped upside down and no one even noticed. Somewhere along the way we stopped caring about everyone else's suffering, which is really sad cause we're all each other has. Divide and conquer strategy is working quite nicely when grown adults can't even have a conversation about something without letting their emotions take over and start screaming, and declare that they'll never talk to anyone who disagrees with them on this or that. The close-mindedness is gonna be our down fall. If we aren't learning we're going backwards. We're already as dumbed down as possible without trying. Our education teaches us nothing except how to listen and repeat for points. And of course how great our evil countries and dictators are. I don't get upset at people who think I'm crazy anymore. I feel so sorry for them. It must be hard to pretend that such a huge lie is the truth. It must feel like the heaviest weight pushing down on you. Defending something that isn't real is pointless. The truth will always find a way. Step out of your comfort zone, it's a lie. It's a cage. The truth will set you free. It will set us all free. Do the world a favor.

2021-10-31T09:29:28Z,"The legal action on behalf of around 500 healthcare workers was aimed at halting the mandate that all healthcare workers in the Tasmanian system must have had at least one vaccination or have an appointment booked by Sunday. An injunction would have suspended the mandate until the Supreme Court could make a final determination on its legality. However, this afternoon,¬†in the Supreme Court in Hobart, Tasmania's Chief Justice Alan Blow refused the injunction on the grounds that he did not believe the case against the mandate had a sufficient likelihood of success. This shows again, that somehow, still, nobody wants to actually listen to the real health experts who are on the front line. But like I said on Friday, why are all these healthcare workers only now complaining against a mandate on them, while still following their orders of vaccinating everyone else and telling people it‚Äôs safe when they know it‚Äôs not?",https://www.facebook.com/MMAMVAUSTRALIA/posts/422322829488151,facebook,PostedOnFacebookActivity

2022-01-04T01:09:42Z,"To the media who have created a storm about what is happening in Canberra, let‚Äôs get a few things straight. I Michael Simms received a call out from my First Nation brothers and sisters to join them on THEIR mission in Canberra. I had 2 options. Ignore the call out an pretend it didn‚Äôt happen or join them and support in any ways I could. When fighting for any freedoms, it‚Äôs hard to ignore that the First Nations people have been fighting for their freedoms for well over 200 years, so it was a no-brainer for me to support. All of our discussions have been about unity and how we can unite and get ALL people to support the fights and rights of the original owners of this land. It‚Äôs sad now that in using my platforms MMAMV to share the word of what is happening, the media are now classifying this as an ‚Äúantivax‚Äù movement. In no group discussions has the jab ever even been mentioned, and the status of each individual is definitely not know (and not cared about). Unfortunately due to the media spin, other indigenous elders who are not here are now making some very misinformed claims including how they fear the ‚Äúyoung children in camp who have never had a vaccine‚Äù. Some other quotes taken from today‚Äôs media story are: There's no protection here for us through the federal government or the ACT Chief Minister. So [Scott] Morrison, the Prime Minister, and the Chief Minister, here they are doing nothing to protect anyone in this vicinity or around the ACT when they let those anti-vaxxers camp down there, Matilda House-Williams said. Jenny Munro added: That presents a risk on an hourly, daily, minute-by-minute basis because they are there. They spread it amongst themselves. They're moving around so they are at risk to anybody who is in close proximity.‚Äù To these elders I highly apologise that my presence here offends you. I am sorry that you fear me and others in the camp even though as you‚Äôve stated you‚Äôve already had 3 shots. I‚Äôm sorry you don‚Äôt realise we are actually here in support of your fight. I will continue to stand and support my brothers, sisters, Aunty and Uncles that are here in camp, leading with love, hope and unity for the future.",https://www.facebook.com/MMAMVAUSTRALIA/posts/461978792189221,facebook,PostedOnFacebookActivity

I think by now, most people with a functioning brain understand you‚Äôll stretch any truth for a story. However your latest nonsense Jessica, makes me want to highlight to the public how ill-informed you all are. I‚Äôll quote your story for reference - ‚ÄúThe millions march against mandatory vaccines group has organised rallies in 30 cities and towns across Australia, including Sydney, where about a thousand turned up.‚Äù As much as I would like to critique an apparently educated journalist on her grammar, I‚Äôll choose to focus on the content itself. ‚ÄúAbout a thousand turned up‚Äù Now, being a journalist I‚Äôm assuming English was your preferred subject, but I‚Äôm pretty confident that even my five year old‚Äôs math skills would allow him to understand the difference between ‚Äúabout a thousand‚Äù and over 100,000. Even the smaller rallies across the country managed to have OVER a thousand attend. Sydney‚Äôs Millions March was the largest it‚Äôs ever seen. You know why? People are seeing through the mainstream propaganda. Around 30 extremely talented and educated souls took to the stage, drawing in record numbers of not just ‚Äúanti-vaxxers‚Äù, but those that have had the vaccine too. Equally standing behind freedom of choice. That is all this has ever been. Freedom of choice. You had an opportunity to shed light on an issue diving the nation. You had an opportunity to let people see this isn‚Äôt a bunch of ‚Äúcrazy angry conspiracy theorists‚Äù, but instead, you continued to sell your soul and hide the truth simply for a catchy headline. These rallies are growing each time, because people have had enough. Why don‚Äôt you come along next time and report even half the truth? I‚Äôm happy to bring my five year old to help you count next time.

As you go about your business today I endeavor you to approach every situation you encounter with kindness. I endeavor you to look at every person you meet and share a kind gesture, as those people and their lives are changing forever. For reasons you may not understand, you may go to your doctor's practice tomorrow to find your gp of 20 years is no longer there. You may arrive at school drop off to find the teacher that has worked so hard to help your child find their place in the world is no longer there. You may attend your lawyers appointment to find you have been assigned someone who knows nothing about your case because your family lawyer is no longer there. You may arrive at your midwife appointment to realize there is actually no one available to care for you because your midwife along with many others, are no longer there. You may arrive at your grandma's aged care facility to find the nurse that would sit and read her favorite books to her is...no longer there. You may arrive to your kindergarten drop off to find the head ECE teacher, the one who supported you through that tough and challenging times is.... no longer there. . You may run into a friend or former work college that looks distant or depressed as they‚Äôve just lost their job and don‚Äôt know how they will keep a roof over their heads. See as you go about your business in the coming days there are thousands and thousands of PEOPLE, thousands and thousands of HUMANS, that for reasons that are NOBODY'S BUSINESS, are facing the last days of a career they worked for years to obtain. Whatever your belief, profession, religion, race, socioeconomic stand point in life, the world needs some extra kindness. Hold humility, humanity and kindness in your heart today. You don't have to understand someone's decision to respect it, and one day I assure you, one of those people listed above who's career was ripped out from under them like a dirty carpet...you‚Äôre going to need them, just as desperately as they needed you...to be kind. #justbekind #freedomkeepers #freedomkeepersunited #mmamv #reclaimtheline",https://www.facebook.com/MMAMVAUSTRALIA/posts/431863155200785,facebook,PostedOnFacebookActivity

I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù and ‚Äúactivists‚Äù post and speak with conviction about how upset they are about children receiving the jab at 5 years of age. Some even believe it‚Äôs the first jab (and youngest) that kids get. It‚Äôs time for EVERYONE to realise that children get over 40 doses of other jabs before they are 5 years old. READ THE AGAIN!! Don‚Äôt try and tell me those ones are safe because the gov, media and doctors you no longer trust told you so. Don‚Äôt try to tell me they were tested much longer than this new one (some were tested for less time). Don‚Äôt try to tell me there were less people injured - that‚Äôs because they give all these to babies and young children when you can‚Äôt notice the effects and your baby can‚Äôt tell you how it‚Äôs making them feel. Don‚Äôt try to say ‚Äúmy kids got them all and they are fine‚Äù. Firstly are they fine? And secondly that‚Äôs the same line that many people who got this new jab say. They got it and are fine. Let‚Äôs be real, if they started giving all these to adults you‚Äôd really start seeing people drop like flies. MMAMV was created before 2020. It was created to share knowledge, education and awareness to all the babies and children being harmed. Don‚Äôt think this wasn‚Äôt alread happening. My son is # 387 on the Australian vaxxed bus. There are tens of thousands on the US version. Majority of children and babies harmed by the jab. It‚Äôs so great that so many now are aware of what‚Äôs going on, but please don‚Äôt leave it at that.

For that reason I have decided to stand for election myself in Canberra. I‚Äôm not a politician, I‚Äôm just a regular Joe standing and fighting for my freedom and yours. I can‚Äôt be bought and I can‚Äôt be swayed from my convictions, and due to that I will be the first person to represent the Informed Medical Options party on the ballot in Canberra.

I consider Uncle Bruce as ‚Äúleft‚Äù yet he says it‚Äôs all about looking after the planet and humanity. Because he fights or stands also for issues some may consider right, the extreme left then want to have a go at him. Therefore the extreme left accuse him of working with the extreme right. To me it‚Äôs as simple as that. A bunch of people extreme left thinking that uncles camp was extreme right without actually ever visiting or speaking to anyone. A bunch of extreme left thinking Uncles camp was ‚Äúwhite supremist‚Äù when each and every white person there was there to help and support the First Nation fight. Each and every white person there where only there to support and help in anyway they could. But the extreme left people (even white people) can only see hate for those that are different. An extreme right person may be exactly the same and hate all ‚Äúleft‚Äù people. If that was the case they definitely wouldn‚Äôt be there to help, and hence, they were not there. Yet the extreme left person believes that is all that is there. Hope that riddle makes some kind of sense. E.g in my videos I try to explain the division as such. No language, no carry on. Simply there is left people who don‚Äôt like right people. On the left peoples videos there is a lot of carry on. ‚ÄúGet the white people out of there. They are white supremists. They are Qtards. They are conspiracy theory. They hate left people etc etc etc. No. Uncles camp was all about unity, love and peace and uniting EVERYONE together.

You may run into a friend or former work college that looks distant or depressed as they‚Äôve just lost their job and don‚Äôt know how they will keep a roof over their heads. See as you go about your business in the coming days there are thousands and thousands of PEOPLE, thousands and thousands of HUMANS, that for reasons that are NOBODY'S BUSINESS, are facing the last days of a career they worked for years to obtain. Whatever your belief, profession, religion, race, socioeconomic stand point in life, the world needs some extra kindness. Hold humility, humanity and kindness in your heart today. You don't have to understand someone's decision to respect it, and one day I assure you, one of those people listed above who's career was ripped out from under them like a dirty carpet...you‚Äôre going to need them, just as desperately as they needed you...to be kind. #justbekind #freedomkeepers #freedomkeepersunited #mmamv #reclaimtheline",https://www.facebook.com/MMAMVAUSTRALIA/posts/431563861897381,facebook,PostedOnFacebookActivity

2021-11-20T22:19:02Z,"Louise Baldock unfortunately not. As stated nobody with autism is the same. I do not like the broadness of it in anyway. As I said when someone is ‚Äúsick‚Äù with cancer it‚Äôs a lot different to being ‚Äúsick‚Äù with a tummy bug. Of course the person sick with the tummy bug can feel sickness and pain and can explain this perfectly. But they actually have no idea what the person who is sick with cancer is going through. For instance me who works in severe autism field argues with the ‚Äúexpert‚Äù behaviour specialists, speech therapists and such every day. This is because the things they suggest may work for a someone who is very high functioning but do not come close to working with someone who is non verbal, uncommunicative, extremely severely violent. You may put on headphones to stop outside noises bothering you. Others will have smashed those headphones into a million pieces in a split second and be pulling your head off for even trying that. Some people may be talking about how they deal with their relationships, while others don‚Äôt leave their house and are sitting in their room right now humming while head butting the wall (and they do that all day). So although I high functioning person with autism has a great deal of wisdom (I myself have brought them in to speak at many a function and training workshop). I still do not believe they understand what a severely autistic person lives through, and if they did, and if they were the greatest at this, they should be working in this field and saving all these people who unfortunately live their lives with not a lot of quality.",https://www.facebook.com/MMAMVAUSTRALIA/posts/409296960790738?comment_id=435045348215899&reply_comment_id=435048241548943,facebook,CommentedOnFacebookActivity

2021-06-25T09:52:50Z,"With all the negativity in the world going on I‚Äôm going to try something different for the next month or so. Each day I‚Äôm going to show gratitude for someone I deeply appreciate and for the work I‚Äôve seen them do. They may have personally helped me, they may have inspired me or may be just a great person - all 3 even üòä Today I‚Äôd like to share my appreciation for Rameka Chin aka Brother Ra. I got the privilege to work with him a month ago. And to be honest it was only probably a month before that that I was introduced to him. Immediately I saw something different. Something that was so lacking in our movement, and seriously in my life. At times I‚Äôd felt disheartened. Often hearing the same angry fear porn fed to me over and over again. I was tired of hearing anger. I was sick of allowing the negative energy of others affect my own. And then there was Ra. He was smiling. He was speaking about hope. About love. About strength. About energy. And boom he had me. What more, he spoke about gratitude. And it was him (unbeknown to him lol) that started me on my own gratitude journey. Ra gave gratitude to me on a video on a day I wasn‚Äôt doing the best, but it picked me up so much. And I knew at that point I needed to pay it forward. And the ripple effects of that has been amazing. Not only have I felt amazing giving it to people, but It‚Äôs managed to make them feel good too, and some of the replies have brought the most beautiful tears to my eyes. The positive energy affects from that, continuing to flow during the day and into everything you do in life. So Brother Ra, thank you for what you do, it‚Äôs so dearly needed. And thank you for starting me on my own journey without you even knowing ‚ù§Ô∏è",https://www.facebook.com/MMAMVAUSTRALIA/posts/339504477769987,facebook,SharedAPostOnFacebookActivity

2021-10-20T03:04:07Z,"A¬†Canberra primary school principal has labelled the ACT government's vaccine mandate¬†for school teachers coercion and said he was ashamed he had not spoken out against the measure sooner. In a Facebook video alongside @senatormalcolmroberts & @mmamv_australia (this page) Primary School principal Rob claimed some teachers at the school were extremely worried about their careers if they refused the vaccine. The 45-minute video was posted to an Australian Facebook group that campaigns against vaccine mandates on Monday.¬† Mr Lans said he chose to speak out about the mandate in response to the supreme amount of fear he claimed was permeating his school community. I'm not in this position because I want to be here.¬†I'm accidentally here, but I also need to stand up for what is right and my values and my belief system, and my health, Mr Lans said. He also¬†said he had been working with other teachers who were concerned about their employment if they refused to be vaccinated. The fear that is coming through at the coercion ‚Äî I've been working with a group of teachers in the last week that are extremely worried about their livelihood, he said. I'm working with teachers in my school setting to try and support them. Mr Lans said he was concerned his stance would make him unable to return to school alongside his students, but not at the sake of having to conform in a way that is forced through these mandates. Now I'm in a position where I won't be there to support my school community through that [transition back to school]¬†and that has been a choice that has been taken away from me now, Mr Lans said. I feel like the trigger has been pulled, but I haven't pulled that trigger. Yet I have to respond to it now. So I am ‚Ä¶¬†going to stand up for what I believe in and stand up for the value of that choice, that pro-information, making informed decisions ‚Äì it is absolute human rights. I actually feel ashamed that I haven't stood up sooner. The Education Directorate is aware of a video circulating on social media featuring a public school principal and is following up this matter in accordance with our internal procedures, a spokesperson said.",https://www.facebook.com/MMAMVAUSTRALIA/posts/415111313542636,facebook,PostedOnFacebookActivity

2022-02-11T09:08:04Z,"Thank you to Denholm Samaras and the Canberra Weekly for writing a fair story for the Canberra Community. ‚ÄúCW visited the campgrounds at Exhibition Park, where thousands have descended upon Canberra to participate in more COVID-19 vaccine mandate protests this weekend. It‚Äôs Friday morning, and from the procession of cars and cacophony of horns, cheering and chants heard outside the main gate at EPIC, add some tyre screeching and you‚Äôd think Summernats had returned to Canberra. Just outside we meet Michael Simms, a Canberra disability worker who, since 15 November 2021, hasn‚Äôt been able to work due to his vaccination status. We jump in a car and are taken on a tour of the expansive campgrounds, where tents, campervans and cars stretch as far as the eye can see. There has been an explosion of campers coming in from across the country this week ahead of large protests planned for Commonwealth Park and Parliament House tomorrow, Saturday 12 January. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs expanded a lot since I first came here two days ago,‚Äù Mr Simms said. Once inside, a pervasive sense of warmth and friendliness is immediately noticeable. A festival atmosphere permeates the showgrounds; the mood is upbeat and positive, with crowds of smiling faces lining the streets waving to cars passing by and saying hello to anyone walking past. Mr Simms is one of the 1.4 per cent, or several thousand, of ACT residents aged over 12 who remain unvaccinated, and has been involved with the Convoy to Canberra anti COVID-19 vaccine mandate protests since they began at the start of last week. In that time, he‚Äôs seen one rowdy day of protests where the police used pepper spray. ‚ÄúNeither side were violent, I don‚Äôt feel, the police or the people,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOne little incident happened, but that was it.‚Äù Being unable to work due to his vaccination status, Mr Simms said his issue lies with the mandates specifically: ‚Äúnot the vaccine in particular‚Äù. ‚ÄúMy family are vaccinated, all my friends are vaccinated, all my work colleagues are vaccinated; there‚Äôs no hate there, it‚Äôs just I don‚Äôt want to get it, and I want to go to work,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere are clients at my job who are unvaccinated, and that‚Äôs okay, I can see my work colleagues after work, I can hang out with them on the weekend ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just the fact I can‚Äôt go to work. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my main fight here, the mandates.‚Äù Having been involved with the protests for over a week now, Mr Simms estimates 90 per cent of people he‚Äôs spoken to are skilled professionals who have lost their job over refusing to get a COVID-19 vaccine. ‚ÄúThe Canberra Noticeboard think everyone here is a bum, but most people here worked until not long ago when they lost their jobs. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre schoolteachers, they‚Äôre nurses, they‚Äôre disability workers; they‚Äôre the occupations that have lost their job ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not people living off Centrelink coming for free food.‚Äù",https://www.facebook.com/MMAMVAUSTRALIA/posts/485572763163157,facebook,PostedOnFacebookActivity
